/*
 * Syscall argument mungers.
 *
 * The data to be munged has been explicitly copied in to the argument
 * area, and will be munged in place in the uu_arg[] array. These
 * mungers are for 32-bit app's syscalls, since 64-bit args are copied
 * from the save area to the uu_args in the order the
 * syscall ABI calls for.
 *
 * The issue is that the incoming args are 32-bit, but we must expand
 * them in place into 64-bit args, as if they were from a 64-bit process.
 *
 * There are several functions in this file with the following prototype
 *
 *	void	munge_XXXX(void *uu_args);
 *
 * The name of the function encodes the number and type of the parameters,
 * as follows:
 *
 *	w = a 32-bit value such as an int or a 32-bit ptr, that does not
 *	    require sign extension.  These are handled by zeroing a word
 *          of output, and copying a word from input to output.
 *
 *	s = a 32-bit value such as a long, which must be sign-extended to
 *	    a 64-bit long-long in the uu_args.  These are handled by
 *	    loading a word of input and sign extending it to a double,
 *          and storing two words of output.
 *
 *	l = a 64-bit long-long.  These are handled by copying two words
 *          of input to the output.
 *
 * For example, "munge_wls" takes a word, a long-long, and a word.  This
 * takes four words in the uu_arg[] area: the first word is in one, the
 * long-long takes two, and the final word is in the fourth.  We store six
 * words: the low word is left in place, followed by a 0, followed by the
 * two words of the long-long, followed by the low word and the sign extended
 * high word of the preceeding low word.
 *
 * Because this is an in-place modification, we actually start at the end
 * of uu_arg[] and work our way back to the beginning of the array.
